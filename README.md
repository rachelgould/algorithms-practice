# Algorithms Practice
Various algorithm exercises for practice

## 1. Two Number Sum
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. Assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.

## 2. Find Closest Value In BST
You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes. Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None (null) values. You are also given a target integer value; write a function that finds the closest value to that target value contained in the BST. Assume that there will only be one closest value.
